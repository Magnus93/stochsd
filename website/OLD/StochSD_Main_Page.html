    <H1>Purpose of <B>Stochastic CSS</B></H1> 
    
    <P><B>Continuous System Simulation (CSS)</B> has long been an inferior and inconsistent type of simulation
    compared to various forms of Discrete Event Simulation (DES). 
    See the paper: <A TARGET = "_BLANK" HREF = "http://www.scirp.org/Journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=66005">
    <I>A guide to population modelling for simulation</I></A>.</P>
    However, by: <BR>
    &nbsp; 1) modelling discrete objects as discrete<BR>
    &nbsp; 2) handling attributes and sojourn times correctly<BR>
    &nbsp; 3) including various types of stochasticities<BR>
    a CSS model can be fully consistent with a DES model.<BR>
    
    <P>Further, in all types of <B>stochastic simulation</B> you need to perform <I>multiple
    simulations</I> of the model followed by a <I>statistical analysis</I>.
    Therefore, a tool for this is required in stochastic CSS modelling.
    Such a tool named <B>StatRes</B> is here presented.</P>
