      <P>To run an example file, click 'StochSD Ex_n' and download it to a saved file on your computer.<BR> 
         Then start StochSD and open the saved file from whithin StochSD.</P> 
    <HR>
    The six examples can also be studied with <B>Insight Maker</B>. However, then no statistical post-analysis is possible.<BR>
